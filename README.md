# Diabetes

Brief Background:
Diabetes affects more than 30 million people, and that is within the United States alone. Think of 10 people - at least one person has diabetes according to this statistic.

Billions of money every year are spent to treating diabetes. It is a non-curable disease requiring daily administrations of insulin, constant tracking of blood glucose levels, and sometimes even hospitalization. If we could help patients suffering from diabetes somehow, what are the areas we should target?
* What requires the most money?
* How can we make tracking glucose levels easier?

Hospitalization requires a lot of money, especially if one does not have health insurance. What if we could build a predictive model that could tell us, based on certain factors, whether a hospitalized patient was likely to be readmitted? And what are some actions we could take to lower patient re-admittance? With these two pieces of information, we can preemptively target those most susceptible to going back to the hospital, funneling our time, personnel, and resources to those that truly need it.

Current Progress
[X] Obtain data resources
[X] Clean data
[X] Initial brute machine learning model
[ ] Feature Selection - visualize correlations and choose most relevant features (reduce noise and overfitting)
[ ] Feature Engineering - create new features from existing data
[ ] Model Selection - try to fit a variety of models to improve performance
[ ] Hyperparameter Optimization - Optimize the settings within each particular machine learning model

About Me:
I am a Computer Science teacher interested in the healthcare, social justice, financial, and technology fields.

My interest in healthcare and social justice stem from the same reason I am a teacher: I am committed to bringing about positive change to this world. My goal is to not only teach students how to program, but also how they can apply their programming skills for good causes. The healthcare field is a huge opportunity for change; the healthcare industry has enormous amounts of data to train machine learning models to not only better treat diseases but also to predict and prevent diseases. Social justice is another huge, overarching section for the advancement of humankind: why do we have the policies we currently do; are policies inherently discriminatory; why has our prison population burgeoned; why are prisoners counted as 'population' for where their prison is (for representative purposes) but they are not given a vote? There are so many things that are concerning that I wish to apply an analytical perspective towards.
